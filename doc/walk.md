## Executive Summary

Statwalker is a high-performance filesystem scanning tool designed to rapidly traverse and catalog filesystem metadata across large directory structures. Built in Rust with a focus on concurrent processing and memory efficiency, Statwalker addresses the critical need for fast, reliable filesystem auditing in enterprise environments where traditional tools often fall short in terms of performance and scalability.

The tool achieves significant performance improvements over conventional filesystem scanners through advanced parallelization techniques, optimized memory management, and platform-specific optimizations while maintaining cross-platform compatibility and data integrity.

## 1. Introduction and Problem Statement

### 1.1 The Challenge

Modern computing environments generate massive filesystem hierarchies containing millions of files. Traditional filesystem scanning tools suffer from several critical limitations:

- **Sequential Processing**: Most scanners process directories sequentially, underutilizing modern multi-core processors
- **Memory Inefficiency**: Poor memory management leads to excessive allocation overhead and cache misses
- **I/O Bottlenecks**: Inadequate buffering and batching strategies result in suboptimal disk utilization
- **Scalability Issues**: Performance degrades significantly with large datasets
- **Platform Inconsistency**: Cross-platform tools often sacrifice performance for compatibility

### 1.2 Business Requirements

Enterprise environments require filesystem scanning tools that can:

- Process millions of files in minutes rather than hours
- Generate comprehensive metadata reports for compliance and auditing
- Operate efficiently across different operating systems and storage types
- Minimize system resource consumption during scanning operations
- Provide reliable, consistent output formats for downstream processing

## 2. Architecture and Design Philosophy

### 2.1 Core Design Principles

Statwalker's architecture is built upon four fundamental principles:

1. **Parallelism First**: Leverage all available CPU cores through work-stealing concurrency
2. **Memory Efficiency**: Minimize allocations and maximize cache locality
3. **Batched Processing**: Group operations to reduce syscall and synchronization overhead
4. **Stream Processing**: Process data in streams to maintain constant memory usage regardless of dataset size

```

### 2.3 Concurrency Model

Statwalker employs a **producer-consumer** pattern with **work-stealing** characteristics:

- **Task Types**: Directory traversal and file batch processing tasks
- **Work Distribution**: Lock-free queue using `crossbeam::channel`
- **Load Balancing**: Dynamic work distribution prevents thread starvation
- **Coordination**: Atomic reference counting for inflight work tracking

## 3. Technical Implementation

### 3.1 Data Structures and Task Model

#### Task Enumeration
```rust
enum Task {
    Dir(PathBuf),                    // Directory to traverse
    Files { 
        base: Arc<PathBuf>, 
        names: Vec<OsString> 
    },                               // Batch of files to process
    Shutdown,                        // Termination signal
}
```

#### Metadata Row Structure
The tool captures comprehensive filesystem metadata:
- **INODE**: Device ID and inode number combination
- **Timestamps**: Access time (atime) and modification time (mtime)
- **Ownership**: User ID (uid) and group ID (gid)
- **Permissions**: File mode bits
- **Size Information**: File size and disk blocks used
- **Path**: Full filesystem path with smart CSV escaping

### 3.2 Worker Thread Architecture

Each worker thread operates in a continuous loop:

1. **Task Acquisition**: Receive tasks from the shared queue
2. **Processing**: Execute directory traversal or file metadata extraction
3. **Output Generation**: Write CSV data to thread-local shard files
4. **Work Generation**: Create new tasks for discovered subdirectories
5. **Coordination**: Update inflight counters for termination detection

### 3.3 Memory Management Strategy

#### Buffer Management
- **Large Pre-allocated Buffers**: 16-32MB buffers reduce allocation frequency
- **Thread-local Storage**: Per-thread buffers eliminate lock contention
- **Batch Flushing**: Write operations triggered by buffer thresholds rather than per-file

#### String and Number Formatting
- **Thread-local Number Formatters**: Reusable `itoa::Buffer` instances
- **Smart CSV Quoting**: Conditional quoting reduces output size and processing time
- **Platform-optimized Path Handling**: Direct byte manipulation on Unix systems

### 3.4 Cross-Platform Compatibility

#### Unix Systems (Linux, macOS, BSD)
- Direct access to POSIX metadata via `std::os::unix::fs::MetadataExt`
- Efficient byte-level path processing using `OsStrExt`
- Native inode and device ID support

#### Windows Systems
- Emulated Unix-style metadata using Windows file attributes
- Path normalization to handle verbatim prefixes (`\\?\`)
- Timestamp conversion from Windows `FILETIME` to Unix epochs
- Approximate block calculation for disk usage reporting

#### Fallback Implementation
- Generic metadata extraction for unsupported platforms
- Graceful degradation with zero values for unavailable fields

## 4. Performance Optimizations

### 4.1 Algorithmic Optimizations

#### Work Batching
Files within directories are processed in batches rather than individually:
```rust
const FILE_CHUNK: usize = 8192;  // Files per batch
```

**Benefits**:
- Reduced task queue operations (8192:1 ratio)
- Better CPU cache utilization
- Lower synchronization overhead

#### Directory-First Processing
Directories are processed immediately while files are batched:
- Enables early parallelization of deep directory structures
- Maintains work queue saturation
- Reduces memory pressure from large flat directories

### 4.2 I/O Optimizations

#### Buffered Writing Strategy
```rust
const FLUSH_BYTES: usize = 4 * 1024 * 1024;  // 4MB flush threshold
const READ_BUF_SIZE: usize = 2 * 1024 * 1024; // 2MB read buffer
```

**Multi-level Buffering**:
1. **Application Level**: In-memory CSV assembly
2. **Writer Level**: `BufWriter` with large capacity
3. **OS Level**: Leverage OS page cache

#### Shard-based Output
- Each worker writes to separate temporary files
- Final merge operation combines shards
- Eliminates lock contention during intensive writing phases

### 4.3 CPU Optimizations

#### Thread Pool Sizing
```rust
let threads = (num_cpus::get() * 2).max(4).min(48);
```

**Rationale**:
- 2x CPU cores optimal for I/O-bound workloads
- Minimum 4 threads ensures parallelization on low-core systems
- Maximum 48 threads prevents excessive context switching

#### Hot Path Optimizations
- `#[inline]` attributes on frequently called functions
- Thread-local static data to avoid repeated allocations
- Conditional compilation for platform-specific optimizations

### 4.4 Memory Optimizations

#### Allocation Reduction
- Pre-allocated vectors with generous capacity
- Reuse of formatters and buffers
- Smart string handling with minimal conversions

#### Cache Efficiency
- Sequential access patterns where possible
- Batch processing improves spatial locality
- Reduced pointer chasing through direct data structures
